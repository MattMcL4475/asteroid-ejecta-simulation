# Asteroid Ejecta Simulation
66 million years ago, a large asteroid about ten kilometers in diameter struck Earth, and created what is known as the [Chicxulub crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater) in Mexico.  The crater is estimated to be 180km in diameter and 20km in depth.  It is widely accepted that it is the cause of the [Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) that caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs.

As a result of that impact, a large amount of material was ejected into space[^1].  Some of that material was bacteria, some of those bacteria can survive exposed in space[^2], and thus it is assumed that some bacteria that can survive in space were ejected alive.  Furthermore, it is hypothesized that some of those bacteria landed on a habitable planet or moon in our solar system, such as Mars, Europa, Enceladus, Titan, Ganymede, or Callisto.
