# Asteroid Ejecta Simulation
66 million years ago, a large asteroid about ten kilometers in diameter struck Earth, and created what is known as the [Chicxulub crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater) in Mexico.  The crater is estimated to be 180km in diameter and 20km in depth.  It is widely accepted that it is the cause of the [Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) that caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs.

As a result of that impact, a large amount of material was ejected into space[^1].  Some of that material was bacteria that can survive exposure to outer space for years[^2], and thus it is hypothesized that some of those live bacteria landed on a habitable planet or moon in our solar system, such as [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)), [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus), [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)), [Ganymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon)), or [Callisto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisto_(moon)).
